# Community Garden Helper
The Community Garden Helper Java Application allows the user to input their climate zone and the current month and will output the crops that can be planted during that month. It will also output when that crop can be harvested.

To learn more about what climate zone you live in, please visit: https://www.gardenate.com/zones/
